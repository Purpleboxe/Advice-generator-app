## The process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JS

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to call from an api using fetch.
I'm quite proud of myself for figuring that out and also for laying out the website with flex.

## Conclusion

In all this project was simple, but still took me some work to do.
I'm glad I could get something out of this project.
